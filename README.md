Recommendation Engine built in Python using GoodReads data

We are all looking for the next best book to read. As part of the Marketing Analytics Course, we attempted to build a recommendation engine in Python using data obtained from Goodreads.

The first step was to perform an in-depth exploratory analysis. We then went on to build a naive model based on KNN using Cosine similarity and Euclidean distance. We also built a content and a user-based recommendation system using the TuriCreate library in Python. 

All of the analysis and model building were performed using Python in Jupyter.
